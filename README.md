## My dojo for training JavaScript

“Kata” is a method of practicing or a systematic way to do things. It is rooted in Japanese martial arts, where students spend a lot of time learning drills to improve certain moves. The correct technique can be learned by repeating the same movement repeatedly. The correct technique becomes part of muscle memory and then it becomes reflexive.
